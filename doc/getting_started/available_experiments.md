### Visual P300 with Oddball paradigm
The visual P300 is a spike that occurs 300ms after perceiving a visual stimulus that has implications on decision making. This was validated in Muse by Alexandre Barachant with the Oddball paradigm, in which low-probability target items (oddballs) are interspersed with high probability non-target items. With AB's paradigm, the experiment takes about 10 minutes to run (5 x 2 minute trials). Although the Muse's sensors aren't in the ideal position for detecting the P300, AB was able to attain "good" accuracy in identifying P300 spikes.

### N170
The N170 is an ERP specifically related to the perception of faces. This was validated in Muse by Hubert with a 12 minute experiment (6 x 2 minute trials). Stimuli consists of 12 pictures of houses and 12 pictures of faces. Accuracy of N170 detection is rather good.

### SSVEP
The steady state visual evoked potential is a frequency response produced visual stimulation at specific frequencies. It was validated by Hubert in a 12 minute experiment (6 x 2 minute trials). Stimulation frequencies of 30hz and 20hz were used and an extra electrode at POz was added. Found clear peaks in the PSD at the stimulation frequencies. The peaks were most significant at the extra electrode, which is closest to the primary visual regions, but was detectable at all electrodes and found to have remarkably high accuracy when using a filter bank approach to isolate specific frequencies.

## Old experiments
### Go/No-Go
An experiment designed to investigate the event-related potentials that can be detected during a Go-No-Go Task, which measures executive, inhibitory control and sustained attention. The subject is rapidly presented with a sequence of circles and squares and is asked to indicate, by pressing the spacebar, whether a shape is a circle.


### SSAEP
The steady state auditory evoked potential is a frequency response produced when hearing modulating tones of certain frequencies. It was validated in Muse by Hubert, who used 45hz and 40hz amplitude modulation applied to 900 and 770h carrier frequencies. A PSD of the produced EEG signal showed clear spikes, correspondingly, at 45 and 40hz in the temporal electrodes. The N100 and P200 complex was also noticed at the beginning of stimulus onset.


### C1 and P1
C1 and P1 are two ERPs related to the perception of a visual stimulus. The C1 is the first component, appearing in the 65-90ms range after stimulus onset while the P1 appears later, around 100ms.

C1 and P1 were validated in Muse by Hubert with a left/right visual field experiment. Comparing ERPs to left or right-field presentation of visual stimuli revealed a contralateral pattern of C1 and P1 in both the temporal and anterior electrodes. However, their timing seems a little delayed.


### Auditory P300
Same as the visual P300, but dependent on auditory stimulus. Auditory P300s are normally less distinguishable than visual P300s, but they may be more suited to the Muse since its electrodes are closer to auditory centers (superior temporal cortex).


## Unvalidated Experiments and other phenomena

### N100 - P200
The combination of a negative evoked potential around 100ms after any unpredictable stimulus and a positive potential 200ms after. These were noticed in Hubert's SSAEP experiment, but not independently classified or tested.

### On-task Beta
Noticed in Hubert's visual grating test, but difficult to extract.

### Alpha reset
A noticeable increase in alpha activity after stimulus presentation ends. Noticed in Hubert's visual grating test.
