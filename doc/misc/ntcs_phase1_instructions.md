If you cannot finish the quiz for any reason, we will be happy to reach out to you and resolve any issues! The form will guide you through that process if you cannot finish the quiz in any way. The procedure for filling out the form is described here: 

 1a. When you click on the link, you should be taken to a page like this, where you might be asked to verify being a human!
